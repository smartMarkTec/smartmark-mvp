Welcome to 10x Facebook Ads!
We’re excited to have you here.
Whether you’ve written Facebook ads before or are a complete beginner - our
goal is to give you a clear process for writing high-converting ads that support
your customer’s journey and win the sale.
A process that you can use again and again for new campaigns, clients,
products and services.
Four simple steps:

1

UNDERSTAND
YOUR FUNNEL

2

FIND YOUR
MESSAGES

3

MAP YOUR
MESSAGES

4

WRITE YOUR
MESSAGES

But before we get started, a note on how to get the most out of this course:
You’ll notice that instead of giving you templates right away, I walk you
through some essential core concepts like understanding value propositions
and funnels. It’s these concepts that will set you up for success - and set you
apart from everyone else. Give yourself the opportunity to watch this content
a few times if you need to soak up the information.

Spend 80% of your time understanding what gets
consistent results, so you can spend an easy 20% of your
time writing high-converting ads that make your audience
say, “Yes please!”
As a bonus, there is a quick-start video available at the end of the course that
you can refer to in the future, once you’re comfortable with the concepts.

Module One:
Facebook and Instagram Ads 101
AD

Key lessons:

4 Teach you the supporting role Facebook and Instagram ads play in an
integrated marketing campaign

4 Spot and map common ecosystems/funnels
•

People are not on social for your ads. You are always up against the friction of
being seen as an advertiser. And as a result we have to be really, really good...

•

We don’t want to bombard future customers with high-friction messages
that are heavily focused on the product or service. Instead, we want to enter
the conversation with the right benefit-driven message, at the right time, to
the right person...

•

We do this by mapping out a collection of touchpoints, supported by a
funnel that helps guide a customer through their journey - from discovery all
the way to sale. A unified, seamless experience (aka integrated marketing).

Module Two:
Anatomy of Facebook and Instagram Ads
AD

Key lessons:

4 The anatomy of an ad and “the threshold of awesome”
4 The various ad placements available and when to use what
When putting together your ads, there’s a really useful concept that I call “the
threshold of awesome.” It helps you take some of the anxiety out of creating
the perfect ad by de-mystifying the most important elements and their general
requirements for success.
When it comes to Facebook ads, these are the most important elements - in
order:
1. The value proposition in your headline.
If you nail the value proposition, your job is 80% done. It is the thing you
should focus on, test and optimize - it is your biggest lever. The good news?
I walk you through how to nail this every time in module five. So for now, all
you need to know is that this is the most important element.
2. The image or the video thumbnail.
While it’s the strength of the value proposition that will get your user to
take action, your image or video thumbnail is the thing that will get people
to stop and take notice as they scroll their newsfeed. We’ll talk about best
practices for creative in module 6. But for now you’ll want to know that this
is the second most important element.
3. The body copy.
Ironically, the body copy is the thing we agonize over the most - but it is
actually the 3rd most important aspect. So while we don’t want to say that
body copy isn’t important, we do want to put it in context of the other
elements. A winning headline and image/video thumbnail can often carry
the weight of an ad all by itself.

The key takeaway? That the success of your ads isn’t up to
luck or mysterious unicorn dust. The success of your ads
comes down to a few specific things that you have control
over.

Ad placement cheat sheet

Some placements are better than others in specific contexts. This cheat sheet is
meant to give you a quick grounding so that you can work with your ads person
or deploy these yourself.

AD PLACEMENT:

GREAT FOR:

Facebook Newsfeed

•

All stages of awareness

•

A tried-and-true placement. You’ll usually want these in
your testing mix

•

Great for testing new copy, value props, creative
because you get the most real estate

•

Retargeting after a user is product aware or most aware

•

Usually quite cheap and because they help you remind
someone of your offer- they can be super profitable

•

Test this in all stages of awareness

•

Gaining popularity and not as crowded for competition
as other placements (yet)

This is by far my favorite part of the course. It’s the key to creating ads that get
higher click-through rates, relevance scores, cost per action and ultimate cost to
acquire a customer.
In this module, I’m going to show you some ninja techniques that allow you to
to find pithy insights from your ideal customers.

Writing High-Converting Messages
AD

Key lessons:

4 The importance of a value proposition
4 How to write ads faster and easier with frameworks and templates
We’re about to get into the writing of your ads!
But first, we have to talk about the ONE thing that will make or break your ad
campaigns.
If there is only one thing you take away from this course - let it be this:
An ad that will get great click-through rates, relevances scores, cost per lead,
registration and ultimately the best cost to acquire is an ad with a phenomenal
value proposition.
And an ad that will get subpar click-through rates, relevance scores, cost per
lead, registrations and costs to acquire are ads with a bad or non-existent value
proposition.

A value proposition is the primary benefit that describes
what your target market will get from your offer. Also
known as the “what’s in it for me” factor. It is the biggest
lever, opportunity and point of failure for your ad.
Knowing this one thing has helped me create winning ad creative for my clients
over and over again. I can literally hop into a client’s campaign, evaluate the
strength of their value prop, tweak it and then optimize their results in a matter
of minutes. Now you’ll know how to do the same thing.
It is essential that you use value propositions at every stage of awareness, for
every ad. Because at the end of the day, people don’t want your products or
services. They want the change, benefit or transformation that it offers.

PAGE 11

Nailing your value proposition is the fastest path to:

4 Increasing your chances of creating high-converting ads on the first try
4 Increasing your click-through rates (which means more traffic)
4 Increasing your relevance scores (which means cheaper costs per action and
better ad account health)

4 Decreasing your cost per action which will ultimately decrease your cost to
acquire your customer

How do you know if you have a strong value
proposition?

QUESTIONS TO ASK
YOURSELF:

YES, NO, MAYBE

Is there a clear benefit?
Are you answering the
“What’s in it for me?”
Is it specific and/or
tangible?

Is it mouth-watering?

Does it help solve the
biggest paint point or
speak to the biggest
aspiration of your target?

P.S. If you want to learn more about value propositions, I highly recommend
MECLABS. It will make you a better marketer and storyteller.
P.P.S. If you’re having trouble coming up with a value proposition for your ads,
then it’s likely that your offer isn’t very strong and is, in itself, lacking a value
proposition. Consider re-working the offer itself.

PAGE 12

Headlines - (aka) the value proposition holder
When in doubt, start writing your ads by grabbing one of the headline formulas
below. You’ll notice that, by using the formulas, you’ll be creating value
propositions for each ad by default (nifty-right?). Some of my favorite tried-andtrue options are:
“How to (benefit) without (objection)”
“How to (benefit) in (certain amount of time)”
“How to (measurable benefit) with (tangible template/cheat sheet/
blueprint)”
Also note that these aren’t hard rules. Some of the headlines can be used in
multiple stages of awareness. This is just meant to help you get started.

This isn’t an exhaustive list, and there is definitely overlap in some of these
headline formulas. But this list includes some tried and true options to get you

Body copy - your opportunity to create desire
Writing body copy is easier than you might expect when you use a formula.
Listed below are some of my favorites. Note that these aren’t hard rules - you
can mix and match however you like. That said, some frameworks and angles
lend themselves better to certain stages of awareness.
Worried that your ad copy might sound like everybody else if you use the angles
and formulas below? The answer to this is to interject your own stories and
specific examples to make the copy feel like your own.

Should you write long copy or short copy?
There’s is a LOT of conversation around whether short copy or long copy is
better when it comes to Facebook ads. And the truth of the matter is that we’re
asking the wrong question.
It’s a question that comes up when we’re looking for hacks or tricks in isolation
of understanding the point behind your copy… which is to communicate a
striking value proposition. End of story. And because we now know that the
elements of your ad that matter the most are:
1. The value proposition
2. The image or the video thumbnail
3. The body copy
We can now see that asking the question of long vs. short copy kind of misses
the point. The goal of your copy is to communicate the strongest value
proposition. And often a wicked headline and phenomenal image or video
thumbnail will do that for you (helping you reach the threshold of awesome).
And listen: I looked far and wide for testing or case studies that would prove
this wrong BUT the ones I found had so little ad spend behind them that I was
like #really? OR, they weren’t true tests where the variables were controlled. So
here’s the key takeaway:

Spend your energy on nailing your value prop and your ad
creative. And then, sure, test a long vs short body copy. But
don’t be held captive by it.

AD

Key lessons:

4 How to avoid banner blindness
4 How to help select and/or evaluate images and videos
The goal of your creative (the image or the video) is to get attention, but NOT to
be loud.
A paradox? Yes.
•

80% of branded social content is being ignored (Havas Media).

•

This is called “Banner Blindness,” defined as, “The tendency of web visitors
to ignore ads, even when those ads contain information visitors are actively
seeking.”

•

Native-style ads are contributing to better brand affinity and higher purchase
intent.

•

So if there is one constant in Facebook ads, it will be to try and look native
to the platform. Native is often the opposite of the loud, hyper designed ads
people think of when they are trying to put together their first few ads.

Banner blindness is real. So shoot for valuable and relevant
in your creative - not loud.

Module Seven:
Landing Pages That Convert
AD

Key lessons:

4 Why landing pages are essential and called the “big swinging door”
4 How to evaluate an effective landing page
The landing page is called the “big swinging door” because it can help to
make or break a campaign. Consider this: Let’s say you have a lead generation
campaign where you’re giving away a free guide.
If your ads are doing a good job, perhaps you are paying $1 a click.
Scenario one: If the landing page converts at 20%, then for every 100 clicks
you send to the landing page, the client gets 20 leads and pays $5 a lead.
Scenario two: If the landing page converts at 70%, then for every 100 clicks
you send to the landing page, the client gets 70 leads and pays $1.42 a lead.
BIG difference, right? Especially when your ad hasn’t changed at all. It’s for that
reason that you’re going to want to understand how to evaluate a landing page.

Once you have the general layout of your landing page
down, the biggest lever that contributes to its ability to
convert is the value proposition of your offer.

ELEMENT:

YES, NO, MAYBE

Is it clear and concise?

Is there ONE focus (no additional options for navigation)?
Does the value proposition match that of the ad that is driving
there?
Is the button obvious, above the fold and in a contrasting color?

Is there social proof?
Is there an image that displays the thing they are going to get or
supports the value proposition?
Do you have as few form fields as possible?

Do you have a privacy policy and terms of service in the footer?

Module Eight: Testing, and
How to Know If Your Ads are “Working”
AD

Key lessons:

4 Rules of thumb for effective testing
4 How to troubleshoot a campaign
You’ve gathered your messages and mapped your customers’ journey in order
to create the ultimate multi-touchpoint campaign. What the heck happens
next? You go into testing.
One note on testing that no one seems to mention: The more tests you run,
the more money you need to spend. So if you have a smaller budget, you want
to be pretty methodical about what you test and in what order.
Generally when I’m testing, I try to answer the following questions in this
order:
•

What value proposition is working best for me at each step of the
funnel?

•

What image or video is performing the best for me at each step of the
funnel?

•

What body copy is performing the best for me at each step of the
funnel?

So while I may have 4 pieces of body copy, 4 images and 4 value props at the
ready, I’m always testing with one specific question in mind at a time.
If you are writing ads for a client, offer to deliver 2 or more value props (aka
headlines) and 2 or more versions of body copy per step in the funnel. Explain
that this allows them/you to test each insight in isolation. And watch them look
at you like the superstar you just became.

The rules of thumb for effective testing

RULES OF THUMB

NOTES

Test one variable at a time

Testing more than one variable at a time will
cause confusion. You won’t be able to isolate
which of the factors is contributing to your
results.

Each test should have a hypothesis or insight

Don’t make the expensive mistake of testing
variations instead of insights. Each test
should come from an insight from your VOC
(e.g., testing one value prop against another)
or from a hypothesis (e.g., we think that
this image of the tangible lead magnet will
perform better than an abstract image of
someone at their laptop).

Each test needs to have enough reach and
budget before you make a decision

If each test gets too little reach or too little
budget and time, you could get a false result.
To add to that, Facebook’s algorithm takes
2-3 days (sometimes longer) to calibrate.
Where possible, work with an ads person
to make sure each test reaches a threshold
where you can trust the results.

Think of testing as gathering data

It’s OK if creating a testing plan confuses you

10X FACEBOOK ADS COURSE WORKBOOK //

We often put a lot of pressure on ads to be
magical. We would do well to think of them
as gathering data. If one value prop didn’t
work, then try another. You’ll already be 20
steps ahead of everyone else because you
completed your VOC research and aren’t
guessing.
An experienced Facebook ads person who is
supporting you or your client should be able
to help you create a plan for testing. Your
job is to write the elements and have them
ready.

- but note that a good portion of those responsibilities lie with the ads manager
(like ad objectives, targeting and placements). For the purposes of ad copy,
we are generally looking at the front end of the funnel and metrics like clickthrough rate, relevance scores, cost per leads and cost per registration.
With that in mind, you’ll want to follow the trail of measurement. So if an ad
“isn’t working,” then ask yourself these questions:

How to troubleshoot your campaign
POINT OF OPTIMIZATION

WHAT TO DO

What is the link click-through rate?

If it is lower than 1%, try a different value
proposition, a different image, a different
audience.

What is the relevance score?

If it is lower than a 5 or 6 out of 10, then try a
different value proposition, a different image,
a different audience.

What is the landing page conversion rate?

If it is lower than 20%, then use the landing
page evaluation checklist (on page 25) to
optimize the elements on the page.

Key metrics and what they mean

KEY METRIC

DEFINITION

SO WHAT?

“Link” click through rate

What percentage of people
click through from the ad
after seeing it?

This tells you whether your
ad is standing out in the
newsfeed and whether you
have a match with your
audience.

Not to be confused with “all
link” click through rate.

Relevance score

You ideally want 1% or
higher.
A roll-up metric out of
10. Facebook balances all
the positive and negative
feedback your ad is getting
and gives you a score out of
10.
You ideally want 7 or higher.

Cost per lead or registration

The cost of each lead or each
registration. This reflects
how effective your whole
sequence is from the ad and
its ability to get the click, to
how well the landing page is
capturing traffic.
The average cost per lead
or registration will vary.
Generally, a low friction
offer like a lead magnet will
cost $2-3, while a webinar
registration can cost
between $5-10 to newer
audiences.

Cost per view

This is the cost per view of
a video, often calculated by
cost per 3-second view or
10-second view. This can be
incredibly cheap - a few cents
per view.

10X FACEBOOK ADS COURSE WORKBOOK //

Your relevance score is an
indicator of the health of
your ad and also of your
account. If your relevance
score is less than 6, there is
work to be done. Try either a
better audience match or a
better offer match.
Work with your ads
manager to identify a
target cost per lead or cost
per registration. If you are
coming in above your goal,
then review your clickthrough rate, your relevance
scores and your landing
page conversion rate for
points of improvement.

Make sure to track video
retention. You want to know
if people are sticking around
for 3 seconds of your video...
or half of your video... or the
whole thing. This information
is essential.

KEY METRIC

DEFINITION

SO WHAT?

Cost to acquire a customer

In this case, cost to acquire
is the cost to acquire a
customer. This is a reflection
of your ad and its ability to
get the click, but also the
funnel and the offer and
their ability to win the sale.

To be profitable, a
company’s lifetime value
of a customer (how much
a customer is worth) needs
to be more than what they
are paying to acquire that
customer. This is something
your ads manager should be
tracking.

Landing page conversion rate

Your landing page
conversion rate is a
reflection of how many
people are converting after
landing on the page (vs
bouncing off).

As we saw in earlier
modules, the landing page
is the “big swinging door.”
Its success will directly
impact how your ad’s
performance is viewed and
measured.

A lead magnet landing
page or webinar registration
page can convert as high as
70-80%, even to brand new
audiences.

Red Flags
AD

Key lessons:

4 How to spot clients who are more likely to be successful and avoid those
that don’t have realistic expectations

Facebook and Instagram ads play a supporting role in an integrated marketing
campaign. In order to get the best results, the client needs a proven offer and a
proven funnel. Anything less than that, and the client needs to understand that
their results may vary. Be sure that they understand they are in “data gathering
mode” and not “make me a million dollars with your magical unicorn copy”
mode.

Facebook ads cannot solve the problem of a bad offer or a
bad funnel.

A red flag checklist for evaluating
whether you should work with
a client
AVOID CLIENTS WHO:

6

•

Do not have a funnel in place

•

Have a new funnel or are launching for the first time and have
unreasonable goals

•

Seem rushed or inexperienced

•

Do not have the support of an ads manager

NOTES

Facebook’s text overlay tool

Use the text overlay tool to make sure that
your ad’s reach won’t be throttled due to
having too much text. Generally you want
text to take up 20% or less of your ad’s
surface area. Any more than that and your
ad’s reach can be negatively impacted.

Facebook ad format guide

Facebook’s ad units and the specifications
for those units is always changing. The ad
format guide will help you stay up to date on
the latest.

Facebook ad compliance rules

Facebook lists the rules and
recommendations they have for staying
compliant. These change, so it is good to
review them every now and then.

Grab and Go Livestream Scripts
Weekly livestreams can be a powerful content marketing strategy
for your business, giving you an opportunity to connect with your
audience.
A few quick tips before we jump in:
•

When running a livestream, start right away. Don’t wait for more people to
join. Most folks will be watching the replay anyway, and what matters most is
keeping things tight so you can keep attention.

•

Go live from your Business Facebook Page! That way you can retarget those
viewers.

The Educational Livestream Script
Livestreams are especially helpful as ongoing, weekly content that is promoted
to your warm audiences. As a result, livestreams can be longer than 1-minute
videos but should still follow a structure.

HEADLINE:

Use a strong, benefit driven headline. When in doubt, use a headline
from the grab-bag of headlines (see page 13).

ATTENTION:

Grab attention right away. Don’t wait for people to join live. The
majority of your views will come after you were live.

INTEREST:

Give your lesson, your actionable advice or your tips

DESIRE:

Explain the benefits of using this information and taking action in
their life.

ACTION:

Because this is weekly content, you may not always have a direct call
to action, like joining a webinar or purchasing a product. Regardless,
find a way to engage your audience. Have them answer questions,
give their opinion, etc.

The Relationship-Building Livestream
Script
Sharing your personal stories can be a powerful tool toward building a
relationship with your audiences. You’ll want to be sincere - your audience will
be able to tell if you’re putting on a show. The goal here is to be motivational,
uplifting and vulnerable (while being as professional as your audience expects).

HEADLINE:

Use a strong headline. When in doubt, use a headline from the grabbag of headlines (see page 13).

ATTENTION:

Grab attention right away. For example: Today, I want to share a
personal story about {vulnerable subject} that you might be able to
relate to.

INTEREST:

Give brief background and be sure to get into the meat of the story
ASAP. Paint a detailed picture of what you were feeling,
thinking, doing. Talk about the turning point. How did you turn
things around? Share one or two insightful takeaways.

DESIRE:

Bring it full circle and say how this can benefit your audience. What
can they learn? Why should this give them hope or
motivation?

ACTION:

Have them answer questions, give their opinion, etc.

The Case Study Livestream Script
Case studies are a great lead-in to all kinds of conversions (lead magnet,
webinar sign-up, challenge sign-up, discovery call sign-up, sales call to action).
The goal here is to handle objections by providing proof that your product,
service, offer can get results.

Use a strong headline. For example: How (client avatar) got a
(benefit).

HEADLINE:

Note that you want to stay away from saying something like “How
Amy 3x’d her business” and instead say something like “How a mom
of two 3x’d her business.” You can see how the second option makes
the case study more relevant to your target audience.

ATTENTION:

I want to share with you how my client got [desirable result].

INTEREST:

Briefly set the stage about how your client was struggling with a
particular challenge. Talk about what your strategy was to help
them deal with this challenge. Be specific. Your audience is trying to
imagine themselves in your solution.

DESIRE:

Paint a picture of how things are different now. Do they have a
website that sells for them? Do they have social media that is
building a loyal tribe? Are they booking more clients? Add stats if you
have them.

ACTION:

Bring it full circle with the call to action. Have them sign up for a
webinar, a discovery call, to get in on your sale before cart closes, etc.

The Sales Livestream Script
If you’ve just kick off a launch, a flash sale or some other sales sequence, a sales
livestream can be super powerful.

HEADLINE:

Promise-based headlines perform really well here. Too often, we want
to lead with the name of the program, as in, Amplify live 2019 is now
open. But your audience doesn’t care about that - they want the
transformation. So instead focus on the main promise or benefit.
For example: New: Get glowing skin with the 21 day reset

PICTURE:

Paint a picture that gets attention and creates desire.

PROMISE:

Describe how your product / service / idea will deliver.

PROVE:

Provide support for your promise (stats, case study, testimonials, etc.).

PUSH:

Ask your viewer to take the next action. Ideally there is some urgency
here.
