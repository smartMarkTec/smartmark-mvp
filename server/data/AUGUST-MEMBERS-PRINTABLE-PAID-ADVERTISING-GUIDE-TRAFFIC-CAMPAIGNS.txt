GETTING STARTED WITH META PAID ADVERTISING
A TRAFFIC CAMPAIGN
Campaigns created with the Traffic objective help you increase traffic to an online
destination of your choice. You can choose to send people to a destination such as your
shop, website or app.
The Traffic objective can help drive people to destinations where they can learn more
about your business or explore your products and services. You can use this objective to
help build consideration for your business and grow your audience of potential future
customers.
Bear in mind the Traffic objective does not optimize for purchases or other conversions,
but can help you reach people more likely to click on your ad. Whether they make a
purchase or not, you can later create new campaigns with audiences based on people
who've previously visited your preferred online destinations.
